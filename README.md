# Readme
This is a program based on machine learning which tries to classify the sentiment of product's comment in JD.

The accuracy of the classifier is about 85% in theory. It isn't good enough but the idea of the program may be useful.I trust that after optimization, this program will work better than now.

You can easily reuse that model only by writing `DataSpider.py` to get your data.

The detail has been shown in my CSDN blog.
